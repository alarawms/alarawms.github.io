As a microbiology-trained professional with a strong foundation in
bioinformatics, I've spent years at the forefront of cutting-edge
research in genomics and high-performance computing (HPC). With a unique blend
of wet lab and molecular biology expertise, coupled with experience in research
management and project development I always aim to the big picture. 

I am passionate for harnessing the power of data to advance our understanding of the microbial world. With a
keen focus on open science principles and the importance of FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data, my mission is to educate others on the vital role that data plays in modern genomics.
